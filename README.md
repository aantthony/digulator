Digulator
=========
Digulator is a game made for the Ludum Dare 29 game jam. My friends and I made it over a weekend, using WebGL, Three.js and other HTML5 and canvas technologies.

It is a simple game that demonstrates the high quality graphics you can achieve with custom WebGL shaders.

You can find the main page for it on the Ludum Dare website:
