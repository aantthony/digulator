digulator
=========

Digging costs time
Get to the end of the level
When you dig, it replaces the block behind you with sand

Goal is to collect X amount of cash
Monster can eat gold/diamond
Diamond blocks take longer to dig, but earn more cash

Limited sight
Can see gold/diamond everywhere though

<!-- start with X amount of fuel
dig in one of the four cardinal directions
each dig costs fuel

some blocks cost more than others

some blocks have fuel
some blocks have cost
some blocks have gold

can retrace your path

start with a small grid, grows as you advance -->
